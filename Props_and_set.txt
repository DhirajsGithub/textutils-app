props ---> properties. properties of component which we tell us what should be include in the components 
props are read only they can't be changed when they are Setting
propTypes --> help to avoid errors

import {react, setState} from 'react'
const [count, setCount] = setState(0)
intial value of count = 0
we can't change value of count = 1
we have to use setCount function, when any function is triggle we can update the value of count as setCount
let total = 0
as setCount(total++)

using of style:
style {{color:'white', margin:'4px'}}   first {} ==> CSS, second {} ==> jacascript object
