applying bootstrap:
copy pasting jacascript script at the end of body and css link in the title tag of index.html in public
you may be facing difficulties while using the code from bootstrap coz some tags don't have the closing 
like img, li, input ... but in JSX all the tags must be closed hence close tags manually or use react bootstrap
some attributes like class, for not changed to className or forHtml hence that's also the problem

hence better use react bootstrap
from: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3
script and css link must go in index.html or we can import it in component directly
