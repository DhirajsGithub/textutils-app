In JSX:
class is named as className   ... use camelCase for every '-'
for is named as forHtml 
tab -- tabIndex

adjust must be wrapped in an eclosing tag, i.e. all that jasx must be wrapped in a single div tag
or we can use a JSC fragment like <>JSX</>

Whenver we use javascript variables or function in JSX we wrapped them in {} bracket, any valid JavaScript expression
You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:
You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:

to change the favicon in public delete the favicon.ico image and use any favicon generated image as favicon.ico 
note only one favicon.ico file exists in public

React Router --> client side rendering rather than server side
https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start
npm install react-router-dom
things to know to use react router 
1. importing: In react-router-dom v6, "Switch" is replaced by routes "Routes". You need to update the import from

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Link, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';

same import must be copy where <a></a> changes to <Link></Link>


path must be taken as : 
<Route path='/about' element={<About/>} /> 
<Route exact path='/about' element={<About/>} />     // --> matches exactly yet react will match partially

path must be in Routes and Routes must be in Router

all <a> tags must be change to <Link></Link> tags and respective href will be change to to="/about"
